CHATTING

      July 20, 2023
      -Chat is soft deleted from the database for public and private channels once a user logs out.
      



DOCKER

      July 21, 2023
      -I have configured docker-compose, it took me a while to configure since I haven't used docker before but it was fun! It's working, I put sqlite3 for the mean time as database since we are
      still in development mode.


STAFF

      July 22, 2023

      -I worked on the staff creation where a link to the form where the staff should be filled up is sent to email. It is working but there are some issues which I will be fixing tomorrow.
